    Flexible Refund and Return Order for WooCommerce <= 1.0.38 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary Order Refund
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Flexible Refund and Return Order for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Missing Authorization in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.38 via the save_refund_request() function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to submit refund requests for arbitrary orders that they do not own.
